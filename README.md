# Advent of Code 2021, solved with Elixir

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is back! Last year (and the year before that), I took a stab at it using [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/), but only had time to solve two problems. This year I’ll try again.

I’ve used Elixir only a few times. Its bizarre elegance intrigues me. Its lack of typical language features like `for` and `while` loops is offset by weirdness like pattern-matching, pipelines, and immutability. I haven’t written enough Elixir to be comfortable or productive with these strange new tools, but they’re foreign enough to be interesting—and who knows what [unknown unknowns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There_are_known_knowns) are lurking beyond my horizon?

Anyway, I’m hoping that a month of occasional floundering with Elixir will expand my mental framework of what programming actually means (like Ruby, Clojure, and functional programming have!). So, onward to the code:

## Instructions

Assuming that Elixir is [installed on your system](https://elixir-lang.org/install.html):

1. Solving the day’s problem:

   `elixir day-01/solve.exs`

2. Running tests:

   `elixir -r day-01/solve.exs day-01/test.exs`

## What I Learned

### Day 1:

Coming soon!
