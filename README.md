# Advent of Code 2021, solved with Elixir

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is back! Last year (and the year before that), I took a stab at it using [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/), but only had time to solve two problems. This year Iâ€™m trying again.

Iâ€™ve only used Elixir a few times, so Iâ€™m hoping that a month of consistent floundering with Elixir will expand my mental paradigm of what programming actually can be (like Ruby, Clojure, and functional programming). So, onward to the code:

## Instructions

Assuming that Elixir is [installed on your system](https://elixir-lang.org/install.html):

1. Solving the dayâ€™s problem:

   `elixir day-01/solve.exs`

2. Running tests:

   `elixir -r day-01/solve.exs day-01/test.exs`

## Lessons Learned

### Day 1:

1. The [Elixir docs](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/) are great and comprehensive and the examples are often relevant to _actual_ problems, compared to many languages. 

2. [`IO.inspect/2` works within pipelines](https://blog.appsignal.com/2021/11/30/three-ways-to-debug-code-in-elixir.html), which is very convenient for debugging. Iâ€™ll be using this trick often:

   ```
   [1, 2, 3]
   |> IO.inspect(label: "before")
   |> Enum.map(&(&1 * 2))
   |> IO.inspect(label: "after")
   |> Enum.sum
   
   # before: [1, 2, 3]
   # after: [2, 4, 6]
   # 12
   ```

3. Maybe/probably Iâ€™m overusing pipelines, but their tidy syntax works for my brain, and [itâ€™s striking](https://github.com/zacwasielewski/adventofcode-2021-elixir/commit/b3d29d08ee8e8a09232e9d73ec42b32346c20554) how effectively they reduce the need to solve one of the [two hard things in Computer Science](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TwoHardThings.html). ðŸ”¥
